What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

A: Primarily learning about different data structures (vector, hash table, bts) and various algorithms.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

A: Keeping an open mind and trying to digest as much information as possible in a short amount of time.
I would suggest that data structures are essential to comprehend because they enable programmers to 
design efficient and scalable software, which is vital in various fields such as software development, 
database management, and algorithm design, among others.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

A: Persistence and research. Whenever I encounter a roadblock, I think of a way to overcome it and attempt that way.
If that way doesn't work out, then I look for another way until I overcome the hurdle.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

A: It has expanded my horizon and knowledge in ways that I am sure I have not yet fully realized.
I am still a college student at this time, but I am sure that the knowledge gained in this course will
in the long run help to gain better employment prospects and a richer life. This is true not just
for the projects but also for the course as a whole.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

A: This course did not focus on programming etiquette, which is something I already understand and implement,
but it did allow me to work with new tools in my final project such as the hash table. Before this course,
I had never utilized such a data structure within a program before.
